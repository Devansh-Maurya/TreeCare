TreeCare uses the metaphor of a flourishing tree with green leaves and fruits to represent someone who is physically active. In the context of this app, a person is physically active if he/she walks or runs daily. If a person does so regularly, he gets more leaves and fruits on the tree, while a tree with no leaf and fruit means zero activity. An empty tree is the default tree.

## Game Modes
To make the game engaging and fun, three modes are provided:
#### 1. Starter mode
#### 2. Challenger Mode
#### 3. Tournament Mode

#### Note: The Tournament Mode is still under development. In the current version, the game only has starter mode and challenger mode.
